# StoreLink Web App

### A web platform for connecting storage finders and lenders

This project is a prototype built using **Flutter** and **Firebase** as part of the "Innovation in Science and Engineering: Entrepreneurship" class group project. The platform helps users find available storage spaces based on their needs and allows individuals to lend out their unused storage space.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Simple email-password authentication using Firebase.
- **Storage Finder**: Users can input their zip code, number of storage boxes, and date range to find suitable storage options.
- **Storage Lender**: Users can upload storage space information, including dimensions, pricing, and availability, as well as photos of the space.
- **Real-Time Data**: Storage listings are stored and retrieved from Firebase Firestore in real-time.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is built with responsive web design in mind, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Flutter Web
- **Backend**: Firebase Firestore for database, Firebase Authentication for user login, and Firebase Storage for image hosting
- **State Management**: Flutter's built-in state management with `setState`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed (Flutter 2.0 or later)
